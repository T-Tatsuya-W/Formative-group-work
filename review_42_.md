# Review from Luca, Josh, Louis, Michael

## i. Interest of content
- Good links and evidence of detailed research
- Varied videos and images across pages
- We like how the title changes colour :)

**Rating: Exemplary**

## ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- Little use of Bootstrap framework (i.e. style classes) to eliminate need for separate `.css` files
- Pages are uniform and well styled and everything is readable/accessible
- Page is workable but not amazing on mobile/smaller devices (Bootstrap would have helped with us)

**Rating: Very Good**

## iii. Quality of written presentation
- 'Junk/redundant files' polluting filesystem (e.g. `StyleSheet.css` and `test2.txt`)
- All webpage text looks good though and links are relevant
- Images are attributed for your sources! üéâ
- Very minor spelling and grammar mistakes (but who really cares?)

**Rating: Outstanding**

## iv. Validity of HTML
- Use of 4 and 2 spaces for indentation is inconsistent - try sticking to one of the two 
  options (preferably 2).
  See [Google Developer Docs](https://developers.google.com/style/html-formatting)
- Some line lengths in the HTML are also too long (over 100 chars) which means they become 
  harder to read on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling
- Some tags have spaces around `=` signs - this is bad practice - "space-less" HTML is easier to 
  read
- Some odd spacing/whitespace between different tags/divs
- One missing/broken image in `simulation.html` but everything else seems valid and good (HTML 
  is grammatically correct if not stylistically)

**Rating: Very Good**

## v. Evidence of collaboration
- Limited use of branches to isolate people's working environments - no PR/Issue use at all
- GitHub Projects tab used to some effect to organise work to do
- Commit messages are questionable at best "yum", "yes", "asdf"
- Really steady flow of commits throughout the project's time from all contributors
- No real last minute rush - everything was completed in good time üëç
- Author information at bottom of all pages

**Rating: Very Good**
