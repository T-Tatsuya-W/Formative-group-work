                <p>When you think of doctors doing all their doctory medical shenanigans, you probably already imagine half of it involving computers or some fancy high tech gizmos. So, here are a couple of my favourite gizmos that make positive contributions to society</p>
                <h3>Medical imaging</h3>
                <p>There are many types of imaging; X-ray, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, etc. However, since x-rays don't really need a computer, as technology is basically a glorified camera, and an ultrasound is essentially a cute little radar detecting ultrasonic waves rather than radio waves, I don't think they satisfy the criteria of being a contribution from computing.</p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, CT stands for COMPUTERISED Tomography, so surely that qualifies them as a contribution from computer science. 

                    CT scans have been used to diagnose, monitor and guide treatments for various conditions, including cancer, as far back as 1971 when the first working model of a CT scanner was use to detect a tumour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A CT scanner uses a narrow x-rays source, and detecters which then transmit to a computer using sophisticated mathematical techniques to construct a 2D image slice of the patient. 
                    Many image slices can then be stacked together to generate a 3d Imgae of the patient. The detail that an imaging techinque like this provides makes observing organs, tissues and any abnormalities considerably easier and allows doctors to make more reliable observations, leading to more successful treatments, which in turn leads to less death. Which is a positive contribution to society.

                <h3>Medical databases</h3>
                <p> 
                    Throughout the healthcare system data is being used more and more than ever before in many different and essential applications. 
                    A recent example, the test and trace service that helps to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    More generally though, medical records like those kept by a GP include your medicine, allergies, vaccinations, previous illnesses and test results, hospital discharge summaries, appointment letters and referral letters. 
                    Information like this become vital any time any new treatment is needed to ensure the best results.
                    Just imagine if a GP prescribed you some medicine that you happened to be allergic to? So it's quite handy they already know.
