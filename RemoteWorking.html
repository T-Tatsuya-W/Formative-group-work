        It is thought that computing computing contributes somewhere between 1.8 and 2.8 percent of global emissions. 
        This predicted number, coming from <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/emissions-from-computing-and-ict-could-be-worse-than-previously-thought"><i>Lancaster University</i></a> 
            suggests that the global emission for computing are more detrimental to the environment than the aviation industry, which emits around 2 percent of global emissions.
