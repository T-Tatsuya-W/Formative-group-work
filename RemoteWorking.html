                It is thought that computing computing contributes somewhere between 1.8 and 2.8 percent of global emissions. 
                This predicted number, coming from <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/emissions-from-computing-and-ict-could-be-worse-than-previously-thought"><i>Lancaster University</i></a> 
                    suggests that the global emission for computing are more detrimental to the environment than the aviation industry, which emits around 2 percent of global emissions.
                    It is estimated that th e power alone for computers costs around $250 billion per year. However, only 15% is actually used performing computation, while the rest is used idling.
                    This all goes to show that it is incredibly important to improve the power efficieny of computers.

                <h2>Company pledges to solve climate change</h2>
                    <p>
                    One company that is taking the initiative is intel, whose <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-launches-first-global-challenges-marks-new-era-shared-corporate-responsibility/"><i>climate strategy</i></a>  have promised to use 100% green power in the production facilities by the year 2030.
                    At the time of this announcement however, Intel CEO (at the time) Bob Swan said 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "one company can't solve climate change"
                    </blockquote>
                <p>
                Thats why other tech companies need to step up and promise to reach climate targets. Dell is another example of a company making a pledge to stop climate change, but solving a different problem
                </p>
                

                <h2>
                    Reducing E-waste
                    </h2>
                <p>
                    Electronics use a wide variety of materials in their production, all of which require electricity (often from green house gases) to manufacture.
                    In the United States alone, there was 6.92 million tons of e-waste in 2019, of which only 15% was recycled. That equates to about 46 pounds of e-waste per person. 
                    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling"><i>EPA (United States Enironmental Protection Agency)</i></a>, 
                    by "recycling one million laptops, it saves the energy equivilent to the electricity used by more than 3,500 US homes in a year."
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Dell has pledged to meet the target that by 2030, they will reuse or recycle an equivilent product.
                    </p>

                <h2>
                    Switzerland handling e-waste
                    </h2>
                <p>
                    While it is good that companies are making an effort to solve these two problems, we cannot rely on big companies to make pledges they may not keep to stop climate change. To prevent E-waste and decrease computing energy consumption, a change in culture has to occur.
                    The best example of this is in Switzerland. Despite being one of the largest produces of e-waste, producing 184 kilotons in 2016 - the country has made an efforts to support the e-waste recyling movement, collecting and recyling 75% of e-waste the year before, at 134 kilotons.
                    This is done by an efficient and conenient recycling system, where the product can be taken to recyling points or electonic shops that sell that equipment.
                    Switzerland's system also faces many challenges however, including:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dangerous materials, such as lithium ion batteries</li>
                        <li>Processing of more complex materials, and processing the wide variety of materials in electonics</li>
                        <li>Dangerous materials, such as lithium ion batteries</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Between Switzerland's robust and convienient recyling opportunities and strong recycling culture, they are a great example of the approach other nations should be taking on how to tackle the growing threat of E-waste.
                    Schemes to improve energy efficency, like energy star in the united states, work in incentivising companies to produce compliant products and consumers to shop smartly. More schemes like this should be introduced to help with rising contributions of computing to climate change.
