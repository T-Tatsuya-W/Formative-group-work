			<h3>AR and VR</h3>
			<p>
				When talking about simulations, we don't just mean technologies like virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR). Simulations that run without additional hardware (like portable devices that support AR and helmets) are used even more widely.
				This is caused by them being more affordable and accessible.
				The VR and AR simulations provide an even more engaging environment for the user.

			<h3>Advantages of Simulations at work</h3>
			<p>
				VR is used a lot to recreate situations that are otherwise unavailable for training.
