        <h2>Here's some page content</h2>
        <p>Well, I didn't know what to write about so here so enjoy whatever this becomes</p>
        <p>Hmm, Applications of Computing that make Positive Contributions to Society, well, let's break this down step by step to gain a better understaning of what we are really looking at.</p>
        <p>So Heres a list of things we will look into closer on this page.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Applications</li>
            <li>Computing</li>
            <li>Positive</li>
            <li>Contributions</li>
            <li>Society</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, now that we have an ordered list of items to investigate, lets start at the most logical place to start, number 2.</p>
        <h2>Computing</h2>
        <p> Incase you cannot be bothered to read, heres a shiny computer for you to look at</p>

        <p>OOOOOoooooOOoOOoooOOOo How shiny</p>
        <h3> now then let's consider the history of computing</h3>
        <p>Computing was first discovered by a group of baby dolphins in 404 AD withing the Bermuda Triangle whilst on magic mushrooms. After this, the history is quite a mystery... <br> BUT THEN! An infant Amelia Earhart who stumbled upon a washed up cyber dolphin (which was dead) began investigating the mysteries of the lost city of Dolphintis, bewildered by the rotting corpse, she passed it onto Charles Baggage who, with his partner in (un)crime Charles Babbage began dissecting, testing and recreating the technological advancements. That is the true history of the Babbage Difference Machine. Only Baggage and Babbage wound up having a bit of a couples spat, got a divorce, Baggage got the children, Babbage got the computer, hence the name of the computer. 
            <br>Anyways back to Amelia, she tried going to the mystical dolphin land in 1937 to discover more of their technical advancements, however, she never returned, causing rather a stir. </p>
        
        <p>Wait wait wait, I found a picture of you!</p>
