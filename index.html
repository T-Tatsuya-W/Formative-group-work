        <h2>Here's some page content</h2>
        <p>Well, I didn't know what to write about so here so enjoy whatever this becomes</p>
        <p>Hmm, Applications of Computing that make Positive Contributions to Society, well, let's break this down step by step to gain a better understaning of what we are really looking at.</p>
        <p>So Heres a list of things we will look into closer on this page.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Applications</li>
            <li>Computing</li>
            <li>Positive</li>
            <li>Contributions</li>
            <li>Society</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, now that we have an ordered list of items to investigate, lets start at the most logical place to start, number 2.</p>
        <h2>Computing</h2>
        <p> Incase you cannot be bothered to read, heres a shiny computer for you to look at</p>

        <p>OOOOOoooooOOoOOoooOOOo How shiny</p>
        <h3> now then let's consider the history of computing</h3>
        <p>Computing was first discovered by a group of baby dolphins in 404 AD withing the Bermuda Triangle. Here the history of the computer was lost for a couple months until Amelia Earhart escaped with a raspberry pi, bewildered by the object, she passed the device onto Charles Baggage. Amelia tried going back in 1937 to the mystical dolphin land to observe more of their technical advancements, however, she never returned, causing quite a stir. </p>
