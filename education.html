<h2>Predicting and avoiding catastrophes</h2>
<p>Millions of lives will and have been saved by AI 
Computer science can save lives!  Artificial intelligence can now be used to help predict natural disasters. It is able to do this by gathering massive amounts of good quality datasets. There are many examples of how AI can be used for different natural diasters
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earthquakes </li>
  <li>Floods </li>
  <li>Volcanic eruptions </li>
  <li>Hurricanes </li>
</ul>

<h2> How AI is used ? </h2>
<p>AI systems can analyze the magnitude and patterns of earthquakes, using this information they are then able to predict the location of earthquakes and aftershocks. By knowing this information in advance they would be able to save many lives as they can instruct evacuation earlier.  
Floods can also be predicted as there are AI-based applications being developed. Using a lot of datasets including things such as rainfall records, they are then able to create flood simulations.
