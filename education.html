<h2> Online resources </h2>
<p>There are many online resources available where the user can research and find information. For instance when a student needs help in finding information about a topic for their thesis or an essay, technology helps them find the relevant and the most accurate information. The internet always has the most up to date information.  Online resources are very useful when students want to develop their understanding as there are video tutorials and explanations. 
</p>

<h2>Easy communication</h2>
<p>Communication has been made easier through the use of computers, especially for those students who are living far from their families. Instant messaging, emails, live updates, and sharing tools help students get in touch with their loved ones easily, even if they are away from home. Simply put, computers and the internet make the world intact despite the distance.
</p>

<h2>Convenience</h2>
<p>With the use of computers, a student’s life has been made very convenient. By just using this device, students can write and research their school works online and communicate with their classmates and teachers through email or other platforms for shared discussions and knowledge. Indeed, a computer is a big help in making student life easier.</p>

<h2>Fast access to research and information</h2>
<p>Before computers, the main source of information came from libraries so it was the only way to research and do assignments. However nowadays the availability of a computer in education makes it a whole lot easier and faster to access everything  needed for research. With a few clicks, students are able to have access to thousands of relevant web pages to help with their research. Nearly every household has access to the internet making it very accessible as it is available on all devices. </p>
